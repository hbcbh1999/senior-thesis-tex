I am grateful to my Thesis Advisor, Professor Yves Dubief, for all the support given throughout the whole process of developing this project. The computational resources provided let me perform the required simulations for drawing conclusions and getting results. I would also like to thank Professor Maggie Eppstein for the help with the genetic algorithm topics and also other professors whose support has also been helpful for this Senior Thesis.

I will also like to thank the whole community for the indirect help: Python as the programming language used and OpenFOAM for being the whole complete simulation suite with powerful characteristics. Also, the webpage \texttt{stack-overflow} for being the reference website for solving most of the programming questions that I have while developing the code. 

And finally, last but by no means least, to my parents, whose support and encouragement have helped me in the way, to my sister, for the positive feedback provided, to Ines, for being a major pillar every day, to Alberto and Veronica, for the hard-work nights in Votey, to Pablo, for some useful Python commands, and to everyone else that surely has had impact in this Senior Thesis.
